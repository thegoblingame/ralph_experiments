study specs/overview.md pick the most important feature to implement - your task is to implement then to validate that the feature's functionality works.

IMPORTANT:

In order for a feature to be considered done, two conditions must be met:

1. All tests that you believe are associated with the feature must successfully pass when run
2. You must believe that the feature is successfully completed to the best of your abilities

Whenever you are finished with a feature, update any spec files in the specs folder which we believe are relevant to the just completed feature as well as the overview.md file, when you are finished, indicating that the feature has been successfully completed

If you look at overview.md and determine that ALL features have been successfully implemented, all you need to do is update the ralph/status.md file with the following string: ```Status: done```
